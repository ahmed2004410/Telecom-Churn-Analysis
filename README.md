# 🧩 Customer Churn Analysis Project
**Power BI | Data Analytics | Customer Insights**

---

## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of **customer churn behavior** to identify the key drivers behind customer attrition and uncover actionable insights. The primary goal is to help the company **reduce the churn rate**, improve the customer experience, and increase revenue retention.

The analysis is powered by a robust **Data Pipeline** engineered using the **Medallion Architecture**, resulting in a highly optimized Star Schema. The final insights are presented through an interactive and comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard** containing five dedicated analytical pages.
Data was modeled into a Star Schema and visualized through an interactive Power BI Dashboard containing five analytical pages.

## 📊 Data Architecture
The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** — a layered data design pattern that improves data quality and scalability across the pipeline.

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data directly ingested from the source system.  
- **Silver Layer:** Cleaned and transformed data used for analysis.  
- **Gold Layer:** Aggregated and business-ready data used in the Power BI dashboards.

## 📊 Data Architecture and Data Model Deep Dive

The project utilizes a dedicated Data Warehouse structured under the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to ensure data quality, reliability, and governance throughout the entire analysis pipeline.

### Medallion Layers Overview

| Layer Name | Purpose and Role | Key Technologies/Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bronze Layer** | **Raw Data Ingestion:** Serves as the landing zone for the raw Telco dataset. Data is stored in its original format. | Initial data load. |
| **Silver Layer** | **Cleaning and Standardization:** This critical layer performed data cleansing, standardization, and feature engineering (e.g., handling nulls, type conversion). | SQL/Power Query (ETL/ELT). |
| **Gold Layer** | **Business-Ready Analysis:** The final, governed layer. Data is aggregated and structured into the **Star Schema** to support high-performance analytical queries in Power BI. | Star Schema Design (Fact and Dimension Tables). |

---

## 🛠️ Data Catalog for Gold Layer

The Gold Layer is the business-level data representation, structured to support analytical and reporting use cases. The model uses a **Star Schema** with the following components (as seen in the Power BI Model View):


### 1. `dim_customer` (Dimension Table)

**Purpose:** Stores static customer demographics and contact information.

### Gold Layer Output: Star Schema Components

The final data model is built on the following key Fact and Dimension tables, created in the **Gold Layer**, with established **One-to-Many** relationships (as shown in the data model schema):

| Table Name (Schema Role) | Description | Primary Key / Foreign Key | Key Attributes (Examples) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `fact_subscriptions` (**Fact Table**) | Contains transactional metrics, customer behavior, and the core churn metrics. | **FKs:** Links to Dimension Tables. | Monthly Charges, Total Charges, TenureMonths, **ChurnFlag**. |

## 🔬 Data Dictionary: Key Field Analysis

This section details the analytical and technical role of the most critical fields, demonstrating how raw data translates into actionable analytical work:

| Field Name | Source Table | Data Type (Power BI) | Analytical Role & DAX Usage Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ChurnFlag** | `fact_subscriptions` | Text (yes/no) | Core Churn Metric. Used in `CALCULATE` functions to define filtered contexts for **Churn Rate %** and **Churned Customers**. |
| **Total Charges** | `fact_subscriptions` | Decimal Number | Basis for financial metrics, e.g., **Total Revenue** and **Churned Revenue**. *Technical Note: Required data cleaning in the Silver Layer to handle initial text/blank values for new customers.* |
| **TenureMonths** | `fact_subscriptions` | Whole Number | Time dimension. Crucial for calculating **Average Tenure** and used in the complex **Average CLTV** formula. |
| **OnlineSecurity** | `dim_services` | Text (Yes/No) | Key dimension for **Service Usage Analysis**. Used with `COUNTROWS(FILTER(...))` to calculate service adoption percentages (e.g., Online Security %). |

## 📊 Dashboard Pages Technical Deep Dive

The Power BI dashboard relies on the structured **Star Schema** data model and leverages complex **DAX measures** to deliver high-impact insights.

---

### 🏠 Home Page

The **Home Page** serves as the dashboard's main entry point and sets the visual tone for the entire report.  

![Home Page](https://github.com/Telco-R3/Telco-BI/blob/f07707c644c6be8c4a871ffcea43c4223b68db16/Customer-Churn-Analysis/Visuals/home_page.png)

--- 

### 📋 Overview Page

| Focus Area | Technical Implementation & Challenges |
| :--- | :--- |
| **KPI Calculations (DAX)** | Relied on measures like **Total Customers** (`DISTINCTCOUNT`) and **Active Customers** (using `CALCULATE` to apply `ChurnFlag = "no"` filter context). |
| **Time Series Prep** | **Tenure Bucketing:** Implemented a Calculated Column or M-Query step to categorize `TenureMonths` for structured time-based analysis. |

### 📉 Churn Analysis Page

| Focus Area | Technical Implementation & Challenges |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Average CLTV (DAX)** | Implemented the most complex measure: **Average CLTV**. This required a row context transition using `AVERAGEX` over `CustomerID` combined with `CALCULATE` and `SUMX`. |
| **Churned Revenue (DAX)** | Used a specific filter context: `Churned Revenue = CALCULATE(SUM('fact_subscriptions'[Total Charges]), 'fact_subscriptions'[ChurnFlag] = "Yes")`. |
| **Sankey Diagram** | Utilized a **Custom Visual** for multi-dimensional path analysis of churn drivers (e.g., Contract $\rightarrow$ Payment Method). |

---

### 👥 Customer Segmentation Page

| Focus Area | Technical Implementation & Challenges |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Segmentation Logic (DAX)** | **Customer segments** (High Value, Mid Value, Low Value) are classified using a **DAX Calculated Column** in `fact_subscriptions` based on thresholds applied to the CLTV metric. |
| **Percentage Metrics** | Segmentation percentages (e.g., High Value Customers %) rely on the pattern `DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER(...)), [Total Customers])`. |


![Customer Segmentation Page](https://github.com/Telco-R3/Telco-BI/blob/507da310821963bfd56f610181480f98737c8273/Customer-Churn-Analysis/Visuals/customer_segmentation_page)

---

### ⚙️ Service Usage Page

| Focus Area | Technical Implementation & Challenges |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Complex OR Logic (Streaming %)** | The measure **Streaming %** required using `VAR`, `DISTINCT`, and the **Logical OR (`||`)** operator within the filter function to account for both Streaming TV and Streaming Movies. |
| **Service Adoption Measures** | Metrics like **Online Security %** are calculated by filtering the `dim_services` table (`COUNTROWS(FILTER(...))`) and dividing by the total number of services (or customers). |


![Service Usage Page](https://github.com/Telco-R3/Telco-BI/blob/0778fc94e7361e08e3c9e9904a5971c5de84db6a/Customer-Churn-Analysis/Visuals/Service_Usage_Page.png)


---

### 🌍 Customer Demographics Page

| Focus Area | Technical Implementation & Challenges |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Demographic Percentage Metrics** | Key metrics like **Dependents %** and **Senior Citizen %** were calculated using the `DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER(...)), [Total Customers])` pattern. |
| **Geospatial Visualization** | Required pre-processing in **Power Query** to ensure geographical data (e.g., City) was clean and compatible with the Power BI Map Visual. |


![Customer Demographics Page](https://github.com/Telco-R3/Telco-BI/blob/7dadb7ab704c69d1950c41bdcb71265483b1563c/Customer-Churn-Analysis/Visuals/customer_demographics_page.png)
