# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
This project provides in-depth data analysis to identify and quantify key factors driving customer attrition (churn) in a telecom setting. Through EDA and statistical correlation, we pinpoint high-risk segments based on service usage, contracts, and demographics, delivering clear, data-driven insights for effective retention strategy planning.
